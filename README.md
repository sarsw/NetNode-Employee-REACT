# NetNode-Employee-REACT

Example of using a .Net WebAPI to interface to a  MSSQL database with a NodeJS React front end. Data is exchanged between NodeJS and the WebAPI using JSON.

Here I add a simple web front end to manage employee and department data, held in a MSSQL database.
I built on the Udemy training courses I've done on NodeJS and REACT.  I've written many C# desktop applications in the past, but was also fairly new to the WebAPI techniques used.

Tools Used:

1) C# WebAPI : Visual Studio 2022 Community Ed,
2) Testing API : Postman,
3) NodeJS/Javascript : Visual Studio Code,
4) DB Admin : MSSQL Server Managment Studio 18

package.json shows the react and bootsrap dependencies.
